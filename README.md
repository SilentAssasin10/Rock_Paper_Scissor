# Rock_Paper_Scissor
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game repository! This project is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" written in C programming language. The game allows a user to play against the computer, providing a fun way to practice C programming and basic game logic.

# Features
User vs Computer Gameplay: Play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.

Randomized Computer Choices: The computer makes random choices to ensure fair gameplay.

Clear User Interface: Simple and intuitive command-line interface.

Score Tracking: Keeps track of wins, losses, and draws.

# Getting Started
Prerequisites:

To compile and run this project, you need:

1. A C compiler (e.g., GCC)/Visual Studio Code (or any other text editor/IDE)

2. Basic knowledge of C programming

# How to Play
The program will prompt you to enter your choice: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

The computer will randomly select its choice.

The winner is determined based on the standard rules of Rock Paper Scissors:
